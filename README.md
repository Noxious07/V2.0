## üöß Issues & Bugs to Fix

### Critical Issues
1. **Skills Page - Styling Missing**: No CSS is being applied to the roadmap. The page needs proper styling and structure.
2. **Projects Page - Double Body Tags**: Invalid HTML structure (two `<body>` tags). Clean this up.
3. **Contact Page - Incomplete**: Only has header and footer. No actual contact form or content.
4. **About Page - Positioning Issues**: Content uses absolute positioning that may break on different screen sizes.

### Code Quality Issues
1. **Duplicate CSS**: Many social media icon styles are repetitive (could use a class)
2. **Inconsistent Styling**: Some pages have proper CSS while others are bare HTML
3. **Missing Font Import**: Skills and Projects pages missing the font imports
4. **Hardcoded Positions**: Absolute positioning in About section won't be responsive
